            <p> My name is Kevin Wang and I graduated Pennsylvania State University studying
                Engineering Sciences, a multidisciplinary program in which student demonstrate their
                knowledge in engineering through completing a capstone project. To which I am able to combine
                my interest in multiple subjects, especially electrical engineering and biomedicine, in the
                Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) lab. My group, which includes students in mechanical and
                biomedical engineering, uses MRI technology in study tissue stiffness, an indicator of cancer and
                other diseases. At Penn State I recieved a cross disciplinary education that allows me to
                enagage problem solving in a unique way.</p>
            <p>Growing up I was immersed in multiple cultures. I was born in Taiwan but grew up in the
                United States, China and Japan. In college I spent time studying abroad in Germany where I learned
                the basics of production management and manufacturing, and experienced their culture. I have a diverse
                cultural knowledge by living and studying in these different countries. </p>
            <p>Currently I am studying some web development skills with UPenn's coding bootcamp. I am 
                learning HTML and CSS, and plan on obtaining more skills in the future 6 months. I plan on entering the
                programming industry and would like to incorporate my multidisciplinary and cross-cultural background
                into my future work.</p>
